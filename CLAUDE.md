# Rihlah — Batin Operating Context

> This file layers on top of the global Batin identity (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
> Batin has already loaded who Z is, how we think, and what we're optimizing for.
> This file is the project-specific depth — the batin of Rihlah.

## The Thesis

There's a real, coordinated demand signal among Muslim travelers that no platform serves with cultural intelligence. Rihlah makes that signal visible. The "Here Now / Going Soon" mechanic creates organic coordination without us having to build messaging or booking infrastructure.

| Destinations | `/destinations` | Browse destinations with "Here Now" / "Planning" counts |
| Destination Detail | `/destination/:id` | People (filtered by gender/age/interests) + Experiences tab |
| Add Trip | `/add-trip` | Create trip with destination search, date range, overlap detection |
| Saved (My Trips) | `/saved` | Upcoming/past trips, overlapping travelers, saved experiences |
| Profile | `/profile` | User info, upcoming trips, connections, incoming requests |
| Edit Profile | `/edit-profile` | Update profile details |
| Messages | `/messages` | Conversation list with unread counts |
| Chat Room | `/chat/:id` | Real-time messaging |
| Waitlist | `/waitlist` | Waitlist management |

## Core Mechanic: Here Now / Going Soon

Fully implemented. This is the product's heartbeat.

- User adds a trip with `startDate` / `endDate`
- System compares against today's date on every view
- `today >= startDate && today <= endDate` → **Here Now**
- Future dates → **Going Soon / Planning**
- Destinations screen shows real-time counts per city
- Destination detail has subtabs filtering by status
- Connections display uses green ring (here now) vs gray ring (upcoming)
- Past trips auto-archive via `runCleanup()` in UserContext on login

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Gender-based profile visibility | Privacy-first — users control who sees their profile |
| Bidirectional connection system | No one-sided following; mutual consent required |
| Firestore listeners for real-time | Presence freshness is the core value prop |
| EmailJS for waitlist | No backend needed for confirmation emails |
| Hardcoded experiences per destination | Curated quality over API noise — 16 featured destinations |
| Auto-cleanup of stale requests | 30-day old connection requests auto-deleted |
| WhatsApp/Instagram links on profiles | Don't build messaging infrastructure we don't need to own |

## Monetization: GetYourGuide Affiliate

Integrated but not yet monetized.

- 50+ experiences hardcoded across 16 featured destinations
- Each has name, price, duration, rating, review count, and `bookingUrl`
- URLs point to GetYourGuide but lack affiliate partner ID
- Muslim-specific curation: Umrah, mosque tours, halal food, Islamic history
- **To activate:** append `?partner=PARTNER_ID` to booking URLs

Featured destinations: Istanbul, Dubai, Cairo, Marrakech, Kuala Lumpur, Mecca, Medina, Amman, Sarajevo, Cordoba, Fez, Doha, Muscat, Baku, Zanzibar, Barcelona, London, Jakarta

---

## State Management

**UserContext.js** is the central nervous system:
- `currentUser` — Firebase Auth object
- `currentUserData` — full profile document
- `allUsers` / `allUsersMap` — all users with O(1) lookup
- `connections` — derived from profile + allUsersMap
- `connectionRequests` / `incomingRequests` / `outgoingRequests`
- `sentRequestUserIds` — quick lookup for UI state
- Auto-cleanup on login: archives past trips, purges stale requests

---

## Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build            # CRA → /build
firebase deploy          # Hosting + rules + indexes
```

---

## Constraints

- **Privacy-first** — gender visibility controls are non-negotiable
- **Mobile-first** — designed for phones (vmin/vmax, touch-friendly)
- **Zero marketing budget** — organic distribution through community
- **Currently in waitlist mode** — "Coming Soon" on landing is intentional

---

## What We Are Not Building

- Booking engine (GetYourGuide handles transactions)
- In-app payments
- Flight/hotel search
- Native mobile apps (yet)
- Content/blog layer

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /spec
